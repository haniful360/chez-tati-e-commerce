This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

# Clone Chez Tati e-commerce website
# Website link: https://chez-tati.vercel.app/
Overview: The project is a frontend replica of the Chez Tati website, designed as an e-commerce platform. The backend functionality is not implemented, and a fake API is used for product data, which is stored in the browserâ€™s local storage. The website includes basic user authentication (login and registration), along with a simple, user-friendly dashboard for users.
